# Ivan Alkhovik

Hello, my name is Ivan Alkhovik. I am a Computer Science student, with a focus in intelligence and simulation, at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Programming has been an aspect of my life since middle school, and I plan to continue putting my efforts into learning more. Below is a portfolio of past projects that I have been a part of:

## Past Projects:

### Computer Simulation (Jan 2023 - May 2023): [https://github.com/IAlkhovik/Computer-Simulation](https://github.com/IAlkhovik/Computer-Simulation)

This is a repository containing projects, coded in Python, related to computer simulation. Currently, these include an initial value problem related to spread of disease within a population and the diffusal of traffic from a traffic jam.

### Tower Defense Game (Aug 2021- Dec 2021): [https://github.com/IAlkhovik/Tower-Defense-Game](https://github.com/IAlkhovik/Tower-Defense-Game)

This is a repository containing a tower defense game, coded in Java/ JavaFX. It was developed in Java/ JavaFX, used a 2-week sprint Agile workplan, and used GitHub for collaboration and version control.
