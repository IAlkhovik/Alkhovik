# Ivan Alkhovik

Hello, my name is Ivan Alkhovik. I am a Computer Science student, with a focus in intelligence and simulation, at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Programming has been an aspect of my life since middle school, and I plan to continue putting my efforts into learning more. Below is a portfolio of past projects that I have been a part of:

## Past Projects:
